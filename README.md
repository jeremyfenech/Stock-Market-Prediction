  # Stock-Market-Prediction

A Python flask website built from the ground up for my Artificial Intelligence Individual Assigned Practical Task (ARI2201). 

A Random Forest model was trained and built (not included due to size restrictions) which is used to predict the next movement of a stock price, in real-time.

Recommendations are given using the previously trained model to predict whether a stock should be sold, held or bought.

The model was trained using a public [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/stock-market-data).
