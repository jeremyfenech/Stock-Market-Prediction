# Stock-Market-Prediction

A Python flask website built for my AI Individual Assigned Prractical Task (ARI2201). 

A Random Forest model was trained and built (not included due to the size) which is used to predict the next movement of a stock price, in real-time.

Recommendations are also given to the user to inform them on wether they should sell/ hold or buy a given stock.

The model was trained using this kaggle dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/stock-market-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/stock-market-data).
