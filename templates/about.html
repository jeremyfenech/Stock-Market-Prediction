    This application is the Individual Assigned Practical Task (ARI2201) 2023
    submission for Jeremy Fenech, at the University of Malta. <br />
    <br />
    The Stock Trader app is the front end to the project. This allows for users
    to interact with the system in a user friendly way. <br />
    <br />
    The app has three main pages: <br />
    - The Daily Movers page, showing which stocks have had the largest positive
    or negative movemnts in the last 24 hours. <br />
    - The Ticker view page. This is the main page of the project and shows a
    selection of predictions, indicators, and information about the stocks.
    <br />
    - And, the Index page which is similar to the mover's page but now allows
    for user's to view stocks from a specific index. <br />
    <br />
    The project is aimed at utilising an AI model to predict the future price of
    stocks. This is done by using the Random Forest supervised machine learning
    algorithm. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    The information provided from this application should not be taken as
    financial advice, but only meant to be used as a tool to help users make
    their own decisions. <br />
